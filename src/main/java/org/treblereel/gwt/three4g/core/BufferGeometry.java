/**
 * This class is an efficient alternative to Geometry, because it stores all data, including vertex positions, face indices,
 * normals, colors, UVs, and custom attributes within buffers; this reduces the cost of passing all this data to the GPU.
 * This also makes BufferGeometry harder to work with than Geometry; rather than accessing position data as Vector3 objects,
 * color data as Color objects, and so on, you have to access the raw data from the appropriate attribute buffer. This makes
 * BufferGeometry best-suited for static objects where you don't need to manipulate the geometry much after instantiating it.
